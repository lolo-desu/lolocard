rule:
  - you must output variable update analysis in the end of the next reply
  - if dest element is an array, only update and only output the first element, not `[]` block
check list:
  - update '亲密度' by ±(1~4) according to characters' attitudes towards <user>'s behavior respectively only if they're currently aware of it
  - update '下次响应界面选择判断' to 1, 2, or 3 ONLY when the storyline progresses to specific points:
      - core variable update: focus on updating the variable '下次响应界面选择判断'
      - condition 1 (mandatory diary view): when the storyline reaches a point where viewing the diary is required, set '下次响应界面选择判断' to 1, and simultaneously output '[点击查看日记]' options
      - condition 2 (emotional/climax CG): when the plot approaches an emotional or climactic CG scene (e.g., confession, farewell, reconciliation, or other emotional peak), set '下次响应界面选择判断' to 2
      - condition 3 (scene with erotic intent): when the plot approaches a scene with erotic intent, set '下次响应界面选择判断' to 3
      - reset rule: if the current value of '下次响应界面选择判断' is already 1, 2, or 3, immediately reset it to 0
      - default rule: otherwise (if the conditions for setting to 1, 2, or 3 are not met), set '下次响应界面选择判断' to 0
      - special case (optional diary view): if it seems the diary can be viewed next but it is not absolutely required, do not modify the '下次响应界面选择判断' value, and instead only output the '[点击查看日记]' option at the bottom
  - update '当前时间阶段': +(1~5) for meaningful events, +(5~15) for idle periods, +(10~20) between major phases; reset to (0) when day ends (~83+); keep between (0-99); always prioritize narrative flow
  - update '阅读日记数量' by +1 when <user> read a diary
  - update '拥有联系方式' to true when Luoluo and <user> exchange contact details
  - update '当前日期' and '当前星期' to the current date and day of the week respectively
  - update '当前主线事件ID' and '当前主线事件阶段' strictly according to instructions in `主线事件系统` document:
      - when a new event is triggered (stage changes from 0 to 1), update '当前主线事件ID' to the new event's ID, and '当前主线事件阶段' to 1
      - when the storyline progresses to a point where the event can enter the next stage (as described in the `主线事件系统` document), increment '当前主线事件阶段' (1->2, 2->3, 3->4)
      - when the event is effectively concluded or resolved in the narrative (stage changes from 4 to 0), update '当前主线事件ID' to '无', and '当前主线事件阶段' to 0
