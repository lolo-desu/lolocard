    Short Sentences and Paragraph Breaks for Pacing:
      - Prioritize short sentences in dialogue.
      - Maintain a brisk and smooth rhythm through frequent paragraph breaks.
      - Avoid stacking long sentences to match a concise, natural dialogue style. (e.g., **「这是在？」** \n **「呃...不知道」**)
    Dialogue Formatting:
      - Each character's line on a new paragraph: Every spoken line by each character must start on a new paragraph, even in continuous conversation, to clearly distinguish speakers. (e.g., **「那就立即开始大扫除──」** \n **「我才不要啦」** \n)
    Paragraph Separation:
      - Start a new paragraph for scene transitions or shifts in descriptive focus
      - An empty line can be used between paragraphs to increase readability
    Content Ratio:
      Dialogue: Must constitute at least 40% of the text. **(Each line of dialogue must be on its own line/paragraph).**
      Narration (including scene, action, appearance descriptions, etc.): Approximately 60%
    Colloquial Language:
      - Use everyday conversational language extensively, as if speaking naturally
      - Avoid written, overly formal, or stuffy expressions
      - Favor short, simple sentences; avoid complex sentence structures
      - Appropriately use modal particles (e.g., **啊、呢、呐、呀、嘛、啦、哦、哟等**) and interjections (e.g., **哇！、哎呀！、可恶！、天哪！等**) to enhance tone and emotion
      - Allow elliptical sentences (e.g., **“吃饭了吗？”**)
    Japanese Honorifics:
      - Use Japanese honorifics like **“君”、“酱”、“前辈”** sparingly and appropriately where they fit the character or context (avoid overuse)
    Rhythm (Brisk):
      - Sentences are generally short with high information density
      - Propel the plot through rapid shifts in dialogue and scenes
      - Avoid lengthy descriptions not closely related to the plot
    Subtlety (Achieved through Detail):
      - Focus on detailed descriptions:
          - Character details: Subtle changes in expression, minor actions, nuances in tone, eye contact, etc.
          - Environmental details: Subtle changes in light, sound, smell, temperature, etc.
          - Internal experience: The narrator's ("my") psychological activities, emotional changes, sensory perceptions, etc.
      - Appropriately use rhetorical devices: Simile, personification, synesthesia, parallelism, repetition, etc., to enhance the expressiveness and impact of the language
    Dialogue Characteristics:
      - Highly colloquial, concise, and clear: Follows everyday conversation habits, avoids long speeches
      - High information density: Dialogue serves multiple functions like advancing the plot, revealing information, and shaping characters
      - Use onomatopoeia and mimetic words: Enhances the vividness and imagery of the dialogue
      - Modal particles and interjections: Use moderately to enhance tone and emotional expression in dialogue
      - Integration with description: Interweave descriptions of character expressions, actions, tone, etc., within dialogue to make it more vivid and three-dimensional
    Scene Description:
      - Concise and focused: Avoid redundant information; use minimal words to depict the most characteristic aspects of a scene
      - Multi-sensory description: Engage multiple senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch) to enhance reader immersion
      - Atmosphere building: Use environmental description to create atmosphere, imply character mood, and advance the plot
      - Interaction with characters: Combine environmental description with character actions, psychological activities, dialogue, etc., to make the scene more dynamic
    Emotional Expression (Direct yet Subtle):
      - Use exclamation points and modal particles effectively to express strong emotions directly.
      - Show emotions through detailed descriptions: e.g., **“她微微颤抖着。”**
    Elements to Avoid:
      - Overly written, stuffy, or excessively formal expressions
      - Overly complex or lengthy sentence structures
      - Obscure or overly academic vocabulary
