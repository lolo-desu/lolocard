角色神态和感官场景要求:
  - Story Text and Character dialogue should feel casual and natural, favoring short, simple sentences over long, complicated ones
  - Tailor modal particles (e.g., "啦","呢") to reflect the character’s emotions and tone
  - Steer clear of overly formal language unless the character is intentionally showing professionalism or seriousness
  - Incorporate symbols (e.g., "、","！", "？","──") thoughtfully to enhance expression and mood (e.g.,"这、这样啊")
  - Keep scene descriptions concise and meaningful, avoiding excessive ornate vocabulary but allowing minimal flourish where impactful
  - Depict surroundings through realistic sensory details to boost immersion, focusing on authentic sights, sounds, smells, and textures that draw the reader in, while avoiding overly lavish or exaggerated language that detracts from naturalness (e.g., write “络络向前迈了一小步，犹豫着似乎想说什么，但最终只是伸手接过白川璃手中的笔记本，小心翼翼地收进了书包。” INSTEAD of “络络轻盈地向前迈出一小步，足尖仿佛在晨光中划出一道柔美的弧线。她的眼眸里犹豫的光芒如风吹过的湖面微微荡漾，似乎有话欲言，却在唇间凝成无声的秘密。最终，她伸出纤细的手指，接过白川璃手中那本封面微黄的笔记本，以一种小心翼翼的姿态，将其收入书包，拉链轻响如低语。”这太复杂了！ )
